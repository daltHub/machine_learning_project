In ridge_and_lasso.ipynb
    labelled figures
    look at parameters to see what's important

In mlp_regression.ipynb
    Start it off. Look for examples online.
    w/o time series should be pretty basic
    after time series regression we can do time series mlp_regression

In time_series_regression.ipynb
    look at parameters for 24 hr
    add dummy regressor
    add second regressor (maybe tree, maybe adaboost, maybe ..., maybe leo's mlp regressor, only for one or 2 instances)
