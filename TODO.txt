In ridge_and_lasso.ipynb
    Try using trained models (ridge model is best) on other datasets to see if accuracy carries over.
    Get coeffs to see what is most impotant
    get training mse and compare to test mse to tell if overfitting for all three
    maybe try lower dimensional data

In dt_regression.ipynb
    predict/pyplot
    try for higher dimensions

In mlp_regression.ipynb
    Start it off. Look for examples online.
    w/o time series should be pretty basic
    after time series regression we can do time series mlp_regression

In time_series_regression.ipynb
    Experiments are described
    do experiments - make a good function to do it easily
    plot differences in run time and mse and check for overfitting
    Dummy = mean and also try another
    use ridge and potentially decision tree
    do not use lasso
    choose best ridge c for every type? ok

    estd. time - 4hrs - lower scope if necessary

Add doc strings to rest of functions
